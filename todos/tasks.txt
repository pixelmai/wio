** Added status to the task model. Need to coded.
** Create a checkbox that will automatically set a task to "completed".
** Ordering of Data by date... for duedates of tasks.
** Listing of UNFINISHED tasks...
-- URL encode task names when using ajax feature for incomplete and complete
-- JSON
-- Fix possible name collisions in tasks, projects, etc.
-- Removing of header CONTEXT in dashboard, when all tasks in the context is completed.
-- Validation of dates in tasks. Must not add, edit a task with a date before "today".
-- Display a message in the task list <ul> if there no tasks to display (ex. all completed)
-- Accepting of tasks now alerts the task_id, due to the edit of URLS
