===================================
PROJECTS
===================================

** Projects can only be set to completed when no tasks are left unfinished
-- Selectable Projects must be "active". 
-- Cannot add a task on completed projects
-- If a project is completed, further editing of tasks must be disabled.
-- Setting a project to completed also modifies all the completed tasks into that date.
